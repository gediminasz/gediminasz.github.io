> Your job in software development is not to build more stuff faster. Your job is to build less. Your job is to minimize the amount of output at the same time that you maximize the amount of outcome and impact that you get.

1. Tell stories, don't just write them
2. Use simple visualizations to anchor the stories you tell
3. Tell the whole story to find the parts that matter most
4. Think things through: minimize output, maximize outcome and impact
5. Build minimum viable product tests to find what's minimum and viable in the market

Effective stories connect everyone to the purpose or your product
